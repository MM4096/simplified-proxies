# Simplified Proxies
## Description
Make print-friendly proxies for MTG and PTCG.

This application supports proxying existing cards through search features as well as custom cards by manually entering information.

The application can be accessed at [simplified-proxies.mm4096.com](https://simplified-proxies.mm4096.com) and the license can be found [here](https://github.com/mm4096/simplified-proxies?tab=License-1-ov-file).


All contributions are welcome! Here's a list of features that are planned:
- [ ] Create print-friendly black-white icons of _all_ MTG icons (71/89 icons converted)
- [ ] Yu-Gi-Oh proxying

## Origins
This project began because its creator couldn't afford colored printing or \[\[Deflecting Swat]].
